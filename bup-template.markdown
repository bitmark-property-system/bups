## Abstract

```A short (\~200 word) description of the technical   issue being addressed```

## Copyright

This BUP is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license.

## Specification

```The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current the Bitmark Blockchain platforms.```

## Motivation

```The motivation is critical for BUPs that want to change the Bitmark Blockchain protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the BUP solves.```

## Rationale

```The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.```

## Backwards compatibility

```All BUPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BUP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.```

## Reference implementation

```The reference implementation must be completed before any BUP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BUP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the the Bitmark Blockchain protocol.```
