## List of BUPs

People wishing to submit BUPs, first should propose their idea or
document to the ???@??? mailing list. After discussion, please open an
issue on Github. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be
published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving BUPs, and try not to be too
involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception
is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is
contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the
conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a BUP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until
its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may
rest with the consensus of the Bitmark Blockchain Community.
